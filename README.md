# An exploratory data analysis of climate change and natural disasters

The objective is to explore and analyse climate change and its relation to natural disasters (occurrence and economic impact). For this analysis, global temperature rise is used as an indicator of climate change. Python is used as the tool for the analysis.<br><br>The source of the global temperature data is the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data by Berkeley Earth.<br>Natural diasaster data is taken from https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters (data published by EMDAT (2019): OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database, Université catholique de Louvain – Brussels – Belgium)
